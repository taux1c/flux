                This plush friend also includes the animal crossing™: New horizons themed bears that would see tom nook and isabelle bears able to be purchased from the site. In case you missed the announcement we&#039;re so excited we could finally share the arrival of isabelle and tom nook as the first launch of our @animalcrossing:
    </p>

    <h3>Each option cost 51 usd, and the only customization option was the sound inside the stuffed animal.</h3>
    <p>Of course, because it&#039;s 2021, you simply can&#039;t just buy a hot item like an animal crossing. While many of us have grown up and out of that phase, it&#039;s not wrong to assume that an animal crossing crossover would get a load of adults queuing up outside the store in the hopes of owning their favorite villager as a plush. Item cannot be purchased unstuffed, cannot be modified. Which villagers were you hoping to see?</p>
